 * Â 
 * Happy Coding :)
 *
 * Given an array arr[] of N positive integers to be inserted into TopicWiseSolutions.Strings.BST and a number X. The task it to find Ceil of X.
 * Note: Ceil(X) is a number that is either equal to X or is immediately greater than X.
 *
 * Input:
 * The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. For each test case, first line of input contains number of elements in the TopicWiseSolutions.Strings.BST, i.e N. Next line contains N elements to be inserted into TopicWiseSolutions.Strings.BST and the last line contains X.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each test case, print the smallest element in TopicWiseSolutions.Strings.BST which is larger than X.
 *
 * Your task:
 * No need to worry about insert function in TopicWiseSolutions.Strings.BST. Just complete the function findCeil() to implement ceil in TopicWiseSolutions.Strings.BST.
 *
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(Height of the TopicWiseSolutions.Strings.BST)
 * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the TopicWiseSolutions.Strings.BST).
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= T <= 100
 * 1 <= N <= 105
 * 1 <= arr[i] <= 105
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * 2
 * 5
 * 5 7 1 2 3
 * 3
 * 6
 * 10 5 11 4 7 8
 * 6
 *
 * Output:
 * 3
 * 7
 *
 * Explanation:
 * Testcase 1: We find 3 in TopicWiseSolutions.Strings.BST, so ceil of 3 is 3.
 * Testcase 2: We find 7 in TopicWiseSolutions.Strings.BST, so ceil of 6 is 7.
