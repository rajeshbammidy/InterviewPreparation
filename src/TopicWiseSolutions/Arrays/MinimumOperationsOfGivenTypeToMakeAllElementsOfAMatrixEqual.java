 * Happy Coding :)
 *
 * Minimum operations of given type to make all elements of a matrix equal
 * Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M and an integer B. In a single operation, B can be added to or subtracted from any element of the matrix. Find and return the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the matrix equal and if it impossible return -1 instead. Note: Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns are numbered from left to right.
 * Input Format
 * The first argument given is the integer matrix A.
 * The second argument given is the integer B.
 * Output Format
 * Return the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the matrix equal and if it impossible return -1 instead.
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= N, M <= 1000
 * -1000 <= A[i] <= 1000
 * 1 <= B <= 1000
 * For Example
 * Input 1:
 * A = [   [0, 2, 8]
 * [8, 2, 0]
 * [0, 2, 8]   ]
 * B = 2
 * Output 1:
 * 12
 *
 * Input 2:
 * A = [   [5, 17, 100, 11]
 * [0, 0,  2,   8]    ]
 * B = 3
 * Output 2:
 * -1

     * Approach:The catch here is:It is given in the question that we can add or substract k from arr[i][j] that means x % K = (x + K) % K = (x â€“ K) % K so mod of all the elements(arr[i][j]) with k should be same.We will make use of this factor to find if it is possible to make all the elements of the 2D array same.
