 * Max Non Negative SubArray
 * Given an array of integers, A of length N, find out the maximum sum sub-array of non negative numbers from A. The sub-array should be contiguous i.e., a sub-array created by choosing the second and fourth element and skipping the third element is invalid. Maximum sub-array is defined in terms of the sum of the elements in the sub-array. Find and return the required subarray. NOTE:
 *     1. If there is a tie, then compare with segment's length and return segment which has maximum length.
 *     2. If there is still a tie, then return the segment with minimum starting index.
 *
 *  Input Format:
 * The first and the only argument of input contains an integer array A, of length N.
 * Output Format:
 * Return an array of integers, that is a subarray of A that satisfies the given conditions.
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= N <= 1e5
 * 1 <= A[i] <= 1e5
 * Examples:
 * Input 1:
 *     A = [1, 2, 5, -7, 2, 3]
 *
 * Output 1:
 *     [1, 2, 5]
 *
 * Explanation 1:
 *     The two sub-arrays are [1, 2, 5] [2, 3].
 *     The answer is [1, 2, 5] as its sum is larger than [2, 3].
 *
 * Input 2:
 *     A = [10, -1, 2, 3, -4, 100]
 *
 * Output 2:
 *     [100]
 *
 * Explanation 2:
 *     The three sub-arrays are [10], [2, 3], [100].
 *     The answer is [100] as its sum is larger than the other two.
