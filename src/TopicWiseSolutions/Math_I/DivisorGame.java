 * Happy Coding :)
 * Divisor game
 * Scooby has 3 three integers A, B and C. Scooby calls a positive integer special if it is divisible by B and it is divisible by C. You need to tell number of special integers less than or equal to A. Constraints:
 * 1<=A,B,C<=1000000000
 * Input:
 * A positive integer A
 * A positive integer B
 * A positive integer C
 * Note:
 * Your code will run against multiple testcases
 * Output:
 * One integer corresponding to the number of special integers less than or equal to A.
 * Examples: Input:
 * 12
 * 3
 * 2
 * Output:
 * 2
 * Explanation:
 * The two integers divisible by 2 and 3 and less than or equal to 12 are 6,12.
