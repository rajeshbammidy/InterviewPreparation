 * Enumerating GCD
 * You are given a number P and a number Q. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all numbers between P and Q inclusive is taken (GCD(P, P+1, P+2 ... Q)). As this problem looks a bit easy, it is given that numbers P and Q can be in the range of 10100. You have to return the value of GCD found. Greatest common divisor of 2 numbers A and B is the largest number D that divides both A and B perfectly. Input:
 * P: String
 * Q: String
 * Output: Your function should return a string which contains the digits of the integer which represents the GCD. The returned string should not have any leading zeroes. Constraints:
 * 1 <= P <= Q <= 10^100
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * P: 1
 * Q: 3
 *
 * Output:
 * 1
 *
 * Greatest divisor that divides both 1 and 3 is 1.
 *
 * Input:
 * P: 3412
 * Q: 3412
 *
 *
 * Output:
 * 3412
 *
 * As both the numbers are the same, greatest divisor that divides 3412 is 3412.
