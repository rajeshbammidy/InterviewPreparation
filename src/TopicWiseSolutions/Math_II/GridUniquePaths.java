 * Grid Unique Paths
 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of an A x B grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below). Path Sum: Example 1 The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below). How many possible unique paths are there? Note: A and B will be such that the resulting answer fits in a 32 bit signed integer. Example :
 * Input : A = 2, B = 2
 * Output : 2
 *
 * 2 possible routes : (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1)
 *               OR  : (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)
