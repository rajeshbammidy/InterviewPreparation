 * Happy Coding :)
 *
 * On a N * M chessboard, where rows are numbered from 1 to N and columns from 1 to M, there are queens at some cells. Return a N * M array A, where A[i][j] is number of queens that can attack cell (i, j). While calculating answer for cell (i, j), assume there is no queen at that cell.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * Queen is able to move any number of squares vertically, horizontally or diagonally on a chessboard. A queen cannot jump over another queen to attack a position.
 * You are given an array of N strings, each of size M. Each character is either a 1 or 0 denoting if there is a queen at that position or not, respectively.
 * Expected time complexity is worst case O(N*M).
 * For example,
 *
 * Let chessboard be,
 * [0 1 0]
 * [1 0 0]
 * [0 0 1]
 *
 * where a 1 denotes a queen at that position.
 *
 * Cell (1, 1) is attacked by queens at (2, 1), (1,2) and (3,3).
 * Cell (1, 2) is attacked by queen at (2, 1). Note that while calculating this, we assume that there is no queen at (1, 2).
 * Cell (1, 3) is attacked by queens at (3, 3) and (1, 2).
 * and so on...
 *
 * Finally, we return matrix
 * [3, 1, 2]
 * [1, 3, 3]
 * [2, 3, 0]
