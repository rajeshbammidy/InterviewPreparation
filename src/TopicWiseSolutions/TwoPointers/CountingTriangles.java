 * <p>
 * Counting Triangles
 * You are given an array of N non-negative integers, A0, A1 ,..., AN-1. Considering each array element Ai as the edge length of some line segment, count the number of triangles which you can form using these array values. Notes:
 * You can use any value only once while forming each triangle. Order of choosing the edge lengths doesn't matter. Any triangle formed should have a positive area.
 * Return answer modulo 109 + 7.
 * For example,
 * A = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
 * <p>
 * Return: 4
