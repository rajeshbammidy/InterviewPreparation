/**
 * Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of strings,
 * where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements
 * are emails representing emails of the account.
 *
 * Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to
 * the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even
 * if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people
 * could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially,
 * but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
 *
 * After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the
 * first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are
 * emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],[
 * "John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John",
 * "johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
 * Output: [["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"]
 * ,["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
 * Explanation:
 * The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email
 * "johnsmith@mail.com".
 * The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses
 * are used by other accounts.
 * We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary',
 * 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'],
 * ['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']]
 * would still be accepted.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: accounts = [["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe3@m.co","Gabe1@m.co"],["Kevin",
 * "Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co","Kevin0@m.co"],["Ethan","Ethan5@m.co","Ethan4@m.co",
 * "Ethan0@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo3@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo0@m.co"],["Fern","Fern5@m.
 * co","Fern1@m.co","Fern0@m.co"]]
 * Output: [["Ethan","Ethan0@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan5@m.co"],["Gabe","Gabe0@m.
 * co","Gabe1@m.co","Gabe3@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo0@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo3@m.co"]
 * ,["Kevin","Kevin0@m.co","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co"],["Fern","Fern0@m.co","Fern1
 *
 * @m.co","Fern5@m.co"]] Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= accounts.length <= 1000
 * 2 <= accounts[i].length <= 10
 * 1 <= accounts[i][j].length <= 30
 * accounts[i][0] consists of English letters.
 * accounts[i][j] (for j > 0) is a valid email.
