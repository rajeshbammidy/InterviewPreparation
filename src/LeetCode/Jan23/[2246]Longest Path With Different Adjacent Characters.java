/**
 * You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles)
 * rooted at node 0 consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. The tree is
 * represented by a 0-indexed array parent of size n, where parent[i] is the parent of
 * node i. Since node 0 is the root, parent[0] == -1.
 *
 * You are also given a string s of length n, where s[i] is the character
 * assigned to node i.
 *
 * Return the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of
 * adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2], s = "abacbe"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different
 * characters in the tree is the path: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3
 * is returned.
 * It can be proven that there is no longer path that satisfies the conditions.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: parent = [-1,0,0,0], s = "aabc"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different
 * characters is the path: 2 -> 0 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == parent.length == s.length
 * 1 <= n <= 10‚Åµ
 * 0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1 for all i >= 1
 * parent[0] == -1
 * parent represents a valid tree.
 * s consists of only lowercase English letters.
