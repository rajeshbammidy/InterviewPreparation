package LeetCode.MonthlyChallenges_22.Oct22;//Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D
//and M. 
//
// 
//Symbol       Value
//I             1
//V             5
//X             10
//L             50
//C             100
//D             500
//M             1000 
//
// For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added 
//together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as 
//XXVII, which is XX + V + II. 
//
// Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
//However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as 
//IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same 
//principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six 
//instances where subtraction is used: 
//
// 
// I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
// X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
// C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900. 
// 
//
// Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: num = 3
//Output: "III"
//Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: num = 58
//Output: "LVIII"
//Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: num = 1994
//Output: "MCMXCIV"
//Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= num <= 3999 
//
