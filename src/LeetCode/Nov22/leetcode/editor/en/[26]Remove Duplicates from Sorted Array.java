/**
 * Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the
 * duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order
 * of the elements should be kept the same.
 * <p>
 * Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages,
 * you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums.
 * More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the
 * first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you
 * leave beyond the first k elements.
 * <p>
 * Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
 * <p>
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying
 * the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 * <p>
 * Custom Judge:
 * <p>
 * The judge will test your solution with the following code:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
 * int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length
 * <p>
 * int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation
 * <p>
 * assert k == expectedNums.length;
 * for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
 * assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
 * }
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,1,2]
 * Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
 * Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of
 * nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
 * It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are
 * underscores).
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
 * Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
 * Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of
 * nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
 * It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are
 * underscores).
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10‚Å¥
 * -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
 * nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
