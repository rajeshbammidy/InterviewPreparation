/**
 * You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate
 * removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.
 * <p>
 * We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
 * <p>
 * Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It
 * can be proven that the answer is unique.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "abbaca"
 * Output: "ca"
 * Explanation:
 * For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent
 * and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that
 * the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "azxxzy"
 * Output: "ay"
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10‚Åµ
 * s consists of lowercase English letters.
 * <p>
