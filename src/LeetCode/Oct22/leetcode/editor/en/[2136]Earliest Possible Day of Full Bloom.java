package LeetCode.Oct22.leetcode.editor.en;//You have n flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin
//to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a 
//seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays plantTime and growTime, of length 
//n each: 
//
// 
// plantTime[i] is the number of full days it takes you to plant the i·µó ∞ seed. 
//Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on 
//planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not 
//complete until you have worked plantTime[i] days on planting it in total. 
// growTime[i] is the number of full days it takes the i·µó ∞ seed to grow after 
//being completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and 
//stays bloomed forever. 
// 
//
// From the beginning of day 0, you can plant the seeds in any order. 
//
// Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
// 
// 
//Input: plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]
//Output: 9
//Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots 
//represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
//One optimal way is:
//On day 0, plant the 0·µó ∞ seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on 
//day 3.
//On days 1, 2, 3, and 4, plant the 1À¢·µó seed. The seed grows for 3 full days 
//and blooms on day 8.
//On days 5, 6, and 7, plant the 2‚Åø·µà seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and 
//blooms on day 9.
//Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
// 
// 
//Input: plantTime = [1,2,3,2], growTime = [2,1,2,1]
//Output: 9
//Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots 
//represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
//One optimal way is:
//On day 1, plant the 0·µó ∞ seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on 
//day 4.
//On days 0 and 3, plant the 1À¢·µó seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms 
//on day 5.
//On days 2, 4, and 5, plant the 2‚Åø·µà seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and 
//blooms on day 8.
//On days 6 and 7, plant the 3 ≥·µà seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms 
//on day 9.
//Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: plantTime = [1], growTime = [1]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: On day 0, plant the 0·µó ∞ seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and 
//blooms on day 2.
//Thus, on day 2, all the seeds are blooming.
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// n == plantTime.length == growTime.length 
// 1 <= n <= 10‚Åµ 
// 1 <= plantTime[i], growTime[i] <= 10‚Å¥ 
//
