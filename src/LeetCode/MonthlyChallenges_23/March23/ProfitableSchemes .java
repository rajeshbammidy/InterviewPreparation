/**
 * There is a group of n members, and a list of various crimes they could commit.
 * The i·µó ∞ crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] members to participate
 * in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in
 * another crime.
 *
 * Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at
 * least minProfit profit, and the total number of members participating in that
 * subset of crimes is at most n.
 *
 * Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very
 * large, return it modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 5, minProfit = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: To make a profit of at least 3, the group could either commit
 * crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
 * In total, there are 2 schemes.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 10, minProfit = 5, group = [2,3,5], profit = [6,7,8]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: To make a profit of at least 5, the group could commit any crimes,
 * as long as they commit one.
 * There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * 0 <= minProfit <= 100
 * 1 <= group.length <= 100
 * 1 <= group[i] <= 100
 * profit.length == group.length
 * 0 <= profit[i] <= 100
